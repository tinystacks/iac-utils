# @tinystacks/iac-utils

## Utility Methods
This package contains stateless utility methods for use in cdk code; particularly useful when developing with the @tinystacks/aws-cdk-constructs node module.

See the [docs](docs/modules.md) for more information.

In addition to the utility methods, this package also contains a cli when installed globally.  The cli can be used to smoke test an AWS CDK application or Terraform configuration.
